Consider the following code segment:
pid t pid;
pid = fork();
if (pid == 0) {
fork();
thread create( . . .);
}
fork();
A. How many unique processes are created?
  The first fork makes two processes due to the fork copying the initial process 2
  the third process is made via the fork in the if statement 1
  Outside the if another is called to duplicate the three processes made prior 3
  2+1+3 = 6 Processes

B. How many unique threads are created?
  There are 8 threads created overall, two initially and two for each of the three processes that can execute.
  2+(2*3) = 8
